# Jon Zimmerman Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal portfolio of my projects, work experience, and hobbies!


![Model](https://github.com/Jon-Zimmerman/Jon-Zimmerman.github.io/blob/main/src/assets/Website_Desktop.JPG)

I built this website in React.js using the MUI styling framework and some styled elements from Roei Yaacobi on Github. I used React Router to handle the page navigation, Framer Motion for the animations, Three.js and Lamina for the interactive model on the homepage, and a highly modular media carousel and page layout component. The code is automatically deployed via a Github action when a pull request is submitted.


The website is visible on ![Model](jonzimm.com)
